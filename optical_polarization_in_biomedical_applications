Optical Polarization in biomedical applications

1) introdction
 - interaction of light can be split into understanding the properties of two biological media
  - weakly scattering media (transparent tissues and fluids, ie. cornea, crystalline lens)
  - strongly scattering media (opaque or turbid tissues and fluids, ie. skin, brain, vessel wall, ball) 
2) tissue structure and optical models
3) polarized light interactions with weakly scattering media
4) polarized light interactions with strongly scattering media
5) polarization properties of tissue and phantoms
6) polarization-dependent interface of multiply scattered light
7) decay of light polartization in random multiple scattering media
8) degree of polarization in laser speckles from turbid media
9) monte carlo modeling of polarization propagation
10) polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography
11) biomedical diagnostics and imaging
