the test directory contains old matlab script called show_polarization.m which was used to show four different polarization states of the loaded RAW image
the current working script is called pol_functional.m and has the option to show the loaded RAW file, four different polarization states and also calculates AoLP and DoLP from Stokes vectors

the directory with the images used for testing is called images and contains multiple different images, some taken at random some taken with a polarized light source
